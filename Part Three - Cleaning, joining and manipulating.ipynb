    "# Part Three - Data Munging (cleaning, joining, manipulating)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Data munging\" refers to a whole host of techniques and processes around loading, joining, and cleaning data. In this tutorial we'll cover a few of those techniques, including some more detail on reading csvs, and a couple of ways of joining DataFrames together. Some of the techniques in this notebook use a common Python expression, the `for` loop. You might want to read up on that to get some familiarity with it, if you've not encountered it before.\n"
