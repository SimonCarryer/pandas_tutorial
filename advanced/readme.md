# Advanced Tutorials
This section is devoted to what I've called "advanced" tutorials, covering a few more complex topics in data analysis. In each case, I'll try to demonstrate what I think is the most straightforward and effective way of achieving an accurate and easily-interpreted result, with clear and concise code.

These tutorials build on some of the basic Pandas techniques in the first tutorials, so if you've completed those, these should be the right level for you to go on with.

## Running these tutorials
Unlike the first tutorials, these notebooks are designed to be run on your local machine. They won't work in Google Colab. You'll need to clone this repository to your local machine, install Anaconda, and run them yourself.
